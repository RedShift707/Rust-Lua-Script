# Rust-Lua-Script

ONLY FOR LOGITECH MOUSE & CAN ONLY BIND USING MOUSE Change the sens you can go down in the script and find it change it to whatever you use in-game and read steps so I don't have to explain it.



bind your weapon by making the "nil" your own hotkey (3, 4 & 5 -> 3 -> mousewheelbutton & 4, 5 -> sidebuttons).
If you still want to use attachments on the weapons, change the "false" to "true".

I am not liable if banned for use of script
